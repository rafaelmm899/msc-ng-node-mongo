# Music!

It is an application developed with angular, nodejs and mongodb as a database, similar to projects like Deezer or Spotify, whose functionality is the reproduction of music. It also provides the user with an interface with which you can create albums, songs and as well as explore the content (songs and albums) of other users. It has its own music player, very similar to the aforementioned applications.
